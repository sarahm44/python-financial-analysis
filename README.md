![Revenue](https://github.com/sarahm44/python-financial-analysis/blob/main/revenue-per-lead.jpg)

## Overview
In this activity, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. 

## Data
I was provided with a financial dataset in this file: [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/sarahm44/python-financial-analysis/blob/main/PyBank/budget_data.csv). 

This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. 

## Tasks Required
My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

## Final Analysis:
My final script is contained in [main.ipynb](https://github.com/sarahm44/python-financial-analysis/blob/main/PyBank/main.ipynb). 

It prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

My resulting analysis is contained in this text file: [Financial_analysis.txt](https://github.com/sarahm44/python-financial-analysis/blob/main/PyBank/Financial_analysis.txt)

It states as follows
